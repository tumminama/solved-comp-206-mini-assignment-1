<u>Question 1: The Linux Manifesto</u>

Google “Linux Documentation Project Manifesto” and for this question, summarize the manifesto in two to four sentences.




<h2><u>Question 2: Software Engineering and the command-line</u></h2>

For this question, you will need to make a screen shot or use your phone to take a picture of your computer screen.  This single photo/screen-shot needs to prove that you answered the following questions. You will submit this picture as your answer to this question:

<ol>

 <li>The command-line prompt must show your user first and last name. You will need to change your prompt by using either the SET PROMPT command or the SET PS1 command (it depends on your shell).</li>

 <li>In lecture 3 week 2 slide 54, we saw how developers working on a software project create a special directory structure that supports their programming efforts.</li>

</ol>




Create the following directory structure within your home directory (each row is a directory name and the indentation implies that it is a subdirectory – for example COMP206 is a subdirectory of Projects, and ass1 is a subdirectory of COMP206):




Projects

COMP206

ass1                archive                backup                docs                assets                database

source

And place the screen-shot and solution document you will create to answer the questions of this assignment in the source directory.  The other directories can be empty.
